      <div class="mb-3">
        We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.
        Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of
        the Agentur Baumeister. The use of the Internet pages of the Agentur
        Baumeister is possible without any indication of personal data; however,
        if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our
        website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the
        processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis
        for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.
        The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail
        address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line
        with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance
        with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the
        Agentur Baumeister. By means of this data protection declaration, our
        enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope,
        and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.
        Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data
        protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled. As the
        controller, the Agentur Baumeister has implemented numerous technical
        and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of
        personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based
        data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute
        protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is
        free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by
        telephone.
      </div>
      <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        declaration of the Agentur Baumeister is based on the terms used by the
        European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection
        Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and
        understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and
        business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the
        terminology used. In this data protection declaration, we use, inter
        alia, the following terms:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-10">
        <li>
          a) Personal dataPersonal data means any information relating to an
          identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An
          identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
          indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a
          name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or
          to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological,
          genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
          person.
        </li>
        <li>
          b) Data subjectData subject is any identified or identifiable natural
          person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible
          for the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          c) ProcessingProcessing is any operation or set of operations which is
          performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not
          by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation,
          structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval,
          consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or
          otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction,
          erasure or destruction.
        </li>
        <li>
          d) Restriction of processingRestriction of processing is the marking
          of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in
          the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          e) ProfilingProfiling means any form of automated processing of
          personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate
          certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular
          to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's
          performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
          interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          f) PseudonymisationPseudonymisation is the processing of personal data
          in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to
          a specific data subject without the use of additional information,
          provided that such additional information is kept separately and is
          subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the
          personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable
          natural person.
        </li>
        <li>
          g) Controller or controller responsible for the processingController
          or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal
          person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly
          with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
          personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are
          determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
          specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or
          Member State law.
        </li>
        <li>
          h) ProcessorProcessor is a natural or legal person, public authority,
          agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the
          controller.
        </li>
        <li>
          i)  RecipientRecipient is a natural or legal person, public authority,
          agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed,
          whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may
          receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in
          accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as
          recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities
          shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules
          according to the purposes of the processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          j)  Third partyThird party is a natural or legal person, public
          authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller,
          processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the
          controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          k) ConsentConsent of the data subject is any freely given, specific,
          informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by
          which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action,
          signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him
          or her.

      <h3>Collection of general data and information</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The website of the Agentur Baumeister collects a series of general data
        and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the
        website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
        files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the
        operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from
        which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4)
        the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
        (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service
        provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and
        information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information
        technology systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using these general data and information, the Agentur Baumeister
        does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this
        information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
        correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its
        advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information
        technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law
        enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal
        prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Agentur Baumeister
        analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with
        the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our
        enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the
        personal data we process.
